**K Dublin** is an artist of many mediums: poetry, prose, film, and coding. Photography is another medium. He's currently making a series titled "Inflation" that takes a look at the contemporary rise in cost of living due to exploitative systems through the lens of 2Pac's "Keep Ya Head Up."

I donâ€™t know where we begin, but I know we end on this earth as the stories others tell about us. So much of my art comes from the assumption that living, or existence, as we know it is liminal. To me, art is a conversation among artists where the world gets to hear the best parts. To join the conversation, all a artist needs to do is take in other's art, understand the traditions at play, and respond. What each artist brings is their personal perspective, their own secret language of understanding and its unique context. Each artist is able to create something that no one else can. You can do it too. Thank you for taking the time to check out my work and joining the conversation.
